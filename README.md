Hello Everyone,

             Java mini project for a cab booking website.
              
Here "register" folder contain the servlet classes.

"java/com/uniquedeveloper/registration" contain the java files which work as backend for website.

The welcome pages and servlet are initiated in web.mxl inside WEB-INF folder.

Also the jar files are inside the "WEB-INF/lib" folder.

The IDE used is Eclipse and MySQL is used for data base and connector-jar file v.8.0.30.jar.

The server used is apache tomcat v.10.1.18.<br>

P.S. I changed the SQL database password for users.

Along with registration page, login page, index page feature like night mode is also included.

Hope you like it.
