Hello Everyone,
              this is my repo for java mini project where a cab booking website is created.
Here "register" folder contain the servlet classes.
"java/com/uniquedeveloper/registration" contain the java files which work as backend for website.
the welcome pages and servlet are initiated in web.mxl inside WEB-INF folder.
also the jar files are inside the "WEB-INF/lib" folder.
the IDE used is Eclipse.
and MySQL is used for data base.
